    "* Too many filters for first 3x3 convolution - will lead to enormous matrix while there's just not enough relevant combinations of 3x3 images (overkill).\n",
    "* Usually the further you go, the more filters you need.\n",
    "* large filters (10x10 is generally a bad pactice, and you definitely need more than 10 of them\n",
    "* the second of 10x10 convolution gets 8x6x6 image as input, so it's technically unable to perform such convolution.\n",
    "* Softmax nonlinearity effectively makes only 1 or a few neurons from the entire layer to \"fire\", rendering 512-neuron layer almost useless. Softmax at the output layer is okay though\n",
    "* Dropout after probability prediciton is just lame. A few random classes get probability of 0, so your probabilities no longer sum to 1 and crossentropy goes -inf."
