    "(please read it at least diagonally)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ultimate quest is to create a network that has as high __accuracy__ as you can push it.\n",
    "* There is a __mini-report__ at the end that you will have to fill in. We recommend reading it first and filling it while you iterate.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "* starting at zero points\n",
    "* +20% for describing your iteration path in a report below.\n",
    "* +20% for building a network that gets above 20% accuracy\n",
    "* +10% for beating each of these milestones on __TEST__ dataset:\n",
    "    * 50% (50% points)\n",
    "    * 60% (60% points)\n",
    "    * 65% (70% points)\n",
    "    * 70% (80% points)\n",
    "    * 75% (90% points)\n",
    "    * 80% (full points)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Restrictions\n",
    "* Please do NOT use pre-trained networks for this assignment until you reach 80%.\n",
    " * In other words, base milestones must be beaten without pre-trained nets (and such net must be present in the e-mail). After that, you can use whatever you want.\n",
    "* you __can__ use validation data for training, but you __can't'__ do anything with test data apart from running the evaluation procedure.\n",

    "## Tips on what can be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Network size__\n",
    "   * MOAR neurons, \n",
    "   * MOAR layers, ([torch.nn docs](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Nonlinearities in the hidden layers\n",
    "     * tanh, relu, leaky relu, etc\n",
    "   * Larger networks may take more epochs to train, so don't discard your net just because it could didn't beat the baseline in 5 epochs.\n",

    "### The main rule of prototyping: one change at a time\n",
    "   * By now you probably have several ideas on what to change. By all means, try them out! But there's a catch: __never test several new things at once__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "   * Training for 100 epochs regardless of anything is probably a bad idea.\n",
    "   * Some networks converge over 5 epochs, others - over 500.\n",
    "   * Way to go: stop when validation score is 10 iterations past maximum\n",
    "   * You should certainly use adaptive optimizers\n",
    "     * rmsprop, nesterov_momentum, adam, adagrad and so on.\n",
    "     * Converge faster and sometimes reach better optima\n",
    "     * It might make sense to tweak learning rate/momentum, other learning parameters, batch size and number of epochs\n",
    "   * __BatchNormalization__ (nn.BatchNorm2d) for the win!\n",
    "     * Sometimes more batch normalization is better.\n",
    "   * __Regularize__ to prevent overfitting\n",
    "     * Add some L2 weight norm to the loss function, PyTorch will do the rest\n",
    "       * Can be done manually or like [this](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/simple-l2-regularization/139/2).\n",
    "     * Dropout (`nn.Dropout`) - to prevent overfitting\n",
    "       * Don't overdo it. Check if it actually makes your network better\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Convolution architectures\n",
    "   * This task __can__ be solved by a sequence of convolutions and poolings with batch_norm and ReLU seasoning, but you shouldn't necessarily stop there.\n",

    "   * Please do try a few simple architectures before you go for resnet-152.\n",
    "   * Warning! Training convolutional networks can take long without GPU. That's okay.\n",
    "     * If you are CPU-only, we still recomment that you try a simple convolutional architecture\n",
    "     * a perfect option is if you can set it up to run at nighttime and check it up at the morning.\n",
    "     * Make reasonable layer size estimates. A 128-neuron first convolution is likely an overkill.\n",
    "     * __To reduce computation__ time by a factor in exchange for some accuracy drop, try using __stride__ parameter. A stride=2 convolution should take roughly 1/4 of the default (stride=1) one.\n",

    "     * Zoom-in+slice = move\n",
    "     * Rotate+zoom(to remove black stripes)\n",
    "     * Add Noize (gaussian or bernoulli)\n",
    "   * Simple way to do that (if you have PIL/Image): \n",
    "     * ```from scipy.misc import imrotate,imresize```\n",
    "     * and a few slicing\n",
    "     * Other cool libraries: cv2, skimake, PIL/Pillow\n",
    "   * A more advanced way is to use torchvision transforms:\n",
